### About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at Universitas Indonesia who’s deeply passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Large Language Models (LLMs). I've had hands-on experience in real-world machine learning projects—from natural language processing to computer vision—and I'm always hungry to learn more.

### Highlighted Project: Heredicheck-AI

[View Project](https://github.com/fassabilf/heredicheck-ai)

Graph-Based Predictive AI for Hereditary Disease Risk Assessment

Heredicheck-AI is a full-stack AI system using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict hereditary disease risks by modeling family relationships from synthetic medical data. Built as part of the MeldRx Predictive AI App Challenge, it features:

- FHIR-compliant synthetic patient generation using Synthea  
- Graph construction with bi-directional family relationships  
- Multi-label prediction of 6 hereditary diseases (e.g., Diabetes, Cancer, Alzheimer’s)  
- GNN modeling using PyTorch Geometric  
- Deployed via FastAPI for real-time healthcare integration  

Technologies used: Python, PyG, FastAPI, Scikit-learn, TF-IDF, GCNConv, Synthea

Check out the repo’s README for a full explanation of the system pipeline, model, and API demo.
