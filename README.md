### About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at Universitas Indonesia who’s deeply passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Large Language Models (LLMs). I've had hands-on experience in real-world machine learning projects—from natural language processing to computer vision—and I'm always hungry to learn more.

Currently serving as Vice Director of Data Science & AI at RISTEK Fasilkom UI, where I help shape cutting-edge AI education for fellow students.

I'm looking for DS&AI internship opportunities to expand my experience and contribute to impactful machine learning systems.
